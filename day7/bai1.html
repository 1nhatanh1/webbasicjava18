          Kanye West isn't just hanging around town with a 
          mystery blonde, he's also married to her -- they recently had a private 
          ceremony to celebrate their love ... TMZ has learned.
          Sources connected to the couple tell TMZ the woman is Bianca 
          Censori, and she's worked as an architectural designer at Yeezy 
          for several years. She's also been a brunette until switching 
          things up to the short blonde look we've recently seen.
          Our sources say Ye and Bianca recently had some sort of wedding 
          ceremony -- though we're told it doesn't appear they've filed a 
          marriage certificate to make it legal.
